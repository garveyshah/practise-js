// A variable allow you to store any value at the given identifier
// To achieve such feat we first need to declare our variable
// We do that using the keyword `let` and then ick an identifier of our liking 
let pouet
console.log(pouet)
// Now the identifier pouet can be use in the the rest of the code 
// but we didn't give any value to our variable so showing it's value 
// wll output undefined
