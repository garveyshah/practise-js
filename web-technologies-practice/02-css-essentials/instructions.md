Objective
To demonstrate understanding and mastery of CSS essentials, including the box model, layouts, responsive design, animations, transitions, and modern CSS features like Grid and Flexbox, by creating a styled personal portfolio webpage.
Project Description
You will create a single HTML page for a personal portfolio, including sections such as Header, About Me, Projects, Skills, Contact, and Footer. The page will be styled using CSS to showcase various CSS techniques and features.
Requirements
1. Box Model and Layouts

Apply margins, paddings, and borders to elements to demonstrate understanding of the box model.
Use at least two different layout techniques, such as floats for the About Me section and positioning for overlays in the Projects section.
Include an element with fixed positioning, such as a "back to top" button.

2. Responsive Design

Implement a mobile-first design approach.
Use media queries to adjust the layout for at least three screen sizes: mobile (<600px), tablet (600px-900px), and desktop (>900px).
Ensure all images are responsive and scale appropriately.

3. Animations and Transitions

Add a fade-in animation to at least one section using CSS keyframes.
Implement hover transitions on navigation links and project thumbnails (e.g., color change, scale effect).
Use transitions for smooth state changes on form inputs when focused.

4. Modern CSS Features

Use Flexbox for the navigation menu and Skills section.
Use CSS Grid for the Projects section to create a responsive grid layout.
Define and use CSS variables for colors and font sizes to maintain consistency.

Additional Requirements

Structure the HTML using appropriate semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, etc.
The webpage must include the following sections:
Header: Logo and navigation menu.
About Me: Profile image and descriptive text.
Projects: Grid of at least four project thumbnails with titles.
Skills: List of at least six skills with icons.
Contact: Form with name, email, message fields, and submit button.
Footer: Copyright information.


Use placeholder text and images.
Ensure the HTML includes the viewport meta tag for responsiveness: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">.
Write all CSS from scratch without using frameworks or libraries.
Organize the CSS logically, using comments to separate sections.

Deliverable

A single HTML file named portfolio.html and a CSS file named styles.css.

Notes

Focus on CSS; do not use any JavaScript.
The page should look visually appealing and demonstrate creativity in design while meeting the technical requirements.
After completing the project, review it to ensure all specified CSS features are implemented correctly.
