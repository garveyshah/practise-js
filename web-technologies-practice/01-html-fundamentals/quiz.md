# Project Title: Conference Webpage

## Objective
To demonstrate understanding and mastery of HTML fundamentals, including semantic HTML5 elements, forms with validation, multimedia integration, and accessibility considerations, by creating a single webpage for a fictional conference.

## Project Description
You will create a single HTML page for a fictional conference. The webpage must include sections such as About, Speakers, Schedule, and Register, and incorporate the following HTML features:
- Semantic HTML5 elements for structuring the content.
- A form with built-in validation for user registration.
- Multimedia elements such as images and either a video or audio file.
- Accessibility best practices to ensure the page is usable by a wide audience.

## Requirements

### 1. Semantic HTML5 Elements
- Use the following semantic elements appropriately: `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.
- Organize content with a clear hierarchy using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
- Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for images to provide context and captions.

### 2. Forms and Validation
- Create a registration form in the "Register" section with the following fields:
  - **Name**: Text input, required.
  - **Email**: Email input, required.
  - **Ticket Type**: Dropdown with at least two options (e.g., General, VIP).
  - **Terms and Conditions**: Checkbox, required.
  - **Submit Button**.
- Use HTML5 validation attributes (e.g., `required`, `type="email"`) to enforce input rules.
- Ensure all form fields are properly labeled using `<label>` elements.

### 3. Multimedia Integration
- Include at least one image in the "About" section and one in the "Speakers" section, each with descriptive `alt` text.
- Embed either a video or an audio element (e.g., a promotional video or podcast) in the "About" section or another appropriate location.
- Use the correct HTML elements for embedding multimedia (`<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, or `<iframe>` if necessary).

### 4. Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all images have meaningful `alt` text.
- Associate form labels with their respective inputs using the `for` attribute.
- Use semantic HTML to create a logical structure that aids screen readers.
- Optionally, enhance accessibility with ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) where beneficial.
- Maintain a logical tab order for keyboard navigation.

## Project Structure
- **Header**: Contains the conference name (`<h1>`) and a logo image with `alt` text.
- **Navigation**: A menu with links to the About, Speakers, Schedule, and Register sections (use anchor links with `href="#section-id"`).
- **Main Content**:
  - **About Section**: Includes a description and at least one image with a caption.
  - **Speakers Section**: Features at least two speakers, each with a name (`<h3>`), image, and bio.
  - **Schedule Section**: Displays a table or list of events with times and descriptions.
  - **Register Section**: Contains the registration form.
- **Footer**: Includes contact information or additional links.

## Additional Instructions
- Use placeholder text and images where necessary (e.g., lorem ipsum for text, placeholder images from free sources).
- For the form, set the `action` attribute to `"#"` and the `method` to `"post"`.
- Do not use any CSS or JavaScript; focus solely on HTML.
- Ensure the HTML is valid and well-structured.

## Deliverable
- A single HTML file named `conference.html` that meets all the specified requirements.

## Notes
- The page will appear plain without CSS, which is acceptable for this project.
- This project is designed as a test of your HTML skills; no implementation is provided, only instructions.
- After completing the project, verify that all requirements are met to ensure mastery of the specified HTML aspects.
